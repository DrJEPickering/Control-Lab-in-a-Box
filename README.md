# Control-Lab-in-a-Box (CLB)

## CLB has been developed to:
* Bridge the gap between control theory and practice
* Develop skills/knowledge from CLB to be transferable, e.g. to a robotic platform
* Incremental approach to learning, i.e., from transfer functions to system identification to PID control
* Easily stored within a lab/office, portable (fits within a typical bag) and low cost (~£100), i.e., doesn’t matter if parts are broken/lost 

## Acknowledgments
Dr James E. Pickering wishes to acknowledge the following colleagues at Aston University for their help in developing Control-Lab-in-a-Box (CLB): Prof Keith J. Burnham, Aaisha Yasir (Design Intern), Stuart Hallard (Technician), David Palmer (Technician) and Amarjit Dhugga (Technician).

## Teaching Curriculum
The table below outlines a schedule for using the nice Control-Lab-in-a-Box (CLB) exercises to support both theory and simulation teaching of control engineering. While the notes for theory and simulation teaching are not included on this page, these can be provided upon e-mail request.

As used in the teaching curriculum, MathWorks Onramp (MATLAB and Simulink) self-paced online courses can be found at this 
[link](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/), and the DC motor virtual lab found at this [link](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/100064-virtual-hardware-and-labs-for-controls)

## CLB Exercises 
For this, Simulink Arduino Support Package is used, details can be found [here](https://uk.mathworks.com/hardware-support/arduino.html?#simulink). Details on how to install the Add-on (i.e., Simulink Arduino Support Package) can be found within CLB-1 (i.e., 
Simulink for Code Generation and Deployment: LED Exercise).

<br /> The nine CLB exercises can be downloaded individually below:

## Trial CLB 
If you wish to trial CLB, this can be posted to you.
<br />I just ask that you return the box within a resonable time-period (e.g., 3 months) and provide user feedback.
