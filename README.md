## CLB has been designed to: 
* Bridge the gap between control theory and practice
* Ensure that the skills and knowledge acquired from CLB are transferable, such as to a robotic platform
* Facilitate an incremental and practical approach to learning
* Be easily stored in a lab or office and portable enough to fit within a typical bag
* Affordable (approximately Â£100), thus reducing concerns if parts are broken or lost

## Acknowledgments
Dr James E. Pickering wishes to acknowledge the following colleagues at Aston University for their help in developing Control-Lab-in-a-Box (CLB): Prof Keith J. Burnham, Aaisha Yasir (Design Intern), Stuart Hallard (Technician), David Palmer (Technician) and Amarjit Dhugga (Technician).

## Setting-Up 
The computer-aided design (CAD) illustration below displays the setup of the Control-Lab-in-a-Box (CLB) with key components labeled. Please note that not all components are detailed in this diagram, e.g., nuts, bolts, and wires.

<br />For the CLB, rapid prototyping methods of 3D printing and laser cutting are employed, with the the 3D printing CAD files available [here](https://github.com/DrJEPickering/Control-Lab-in-a-Box/blob/main/CAD_files_for_3D_printing.zip) and the laser cutting CAD files available [here](https://github.com/DrJEPickering/Control-Lab-in-a-Box/blob/main/CAD_files_to_be_laser_cut.zip). For the CAD files, Solidworks 2023 files are provided, along with the correspondng STL files.

<br />A document detailing the parts/components necessary for the full utilisation of CLB is provided [here](https://github.com/DrJEPickering/Control-Lab-in-a-Box/blob/main/CLB_component_details.pdf). Additionally, a document detailing the assembly instructions and modifications for parts/components is included [here](https://github.com/DrJEPickering/Control-Lab-in-a-Box/blob/main/Assembly_modifications_Instructions.pdf)

## Teaching Curriculum
The table below presents a schedule for integrating the Control-Lab-in-a-Box (CLB) exercises into the teaching of control engineering theory and simulation. Although the notes for theory and simulation are not provided on this page, they are available upon request via email.

Additionally, the MathWorks Onramp self-paced online courses for MATLAB and Simulink, used in the teaching curriculum, can be accessed through the provided [link](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/). 
The DC motor virtual lab is also available at the specified [link](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/100064-virtual-hardware-and-labs-for-controls).

## CLB Exercises 
Control-Lab-in-a-Box (CLB) is used for nine exercises (available to download via the links beneaf the illustration below), with these detailed via the illustration below. For the nine CLB exercises, Simulink Arduino Support Package is used, details can be found [here](https://uk.mathworks.com/hardware-support/arduino.html?#simulink). Details on how to install the Add-on (i.e., Simulink Arduino Support Package) can be found within CLB-1 (i.e., Simulink for Code Generation and Deployment: LED Exercise).
